A community tool for BlendOS similar to [apx](https://github.com/Vanilla-OS/apx/) from the [VanillaOS](https://vanillaos.org/) project.  

bpkg allows you to automatically search for a package through the repositories of your containers and automaticallly selects the best package according to your preference.  

**NOTE:** This program is currently being rewritten from scratch and is mostly functional but needs testing and some features are not implemented yet.
